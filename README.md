# RemindMeMunni

An Android app that serves as a pseudo-expense/munni tracker/reminder thingy.

## Features

* Create items with an (optional) due-date and cost.
* Create a series for items that recur over set periods. Series allow for auto-filling details of new items in the series, in addition to auto-generation of items if desired.
* Categorise items/series and search by name and category.
* Set current munni and the prediction-end-point to allow the app to estimate current funds as transactions (items) are completed and approximate how much munni will be leftover at the end of a set interval.

## Getting Started

### Installation

No installation packages are provided. The user is expected to build and install the app onto their devices themselves.

### Usage

* Navigation between pages is done by either swiping left/right or tapping on the desired page's header. A series's items can be found by tapping on that series.
* Current munni and the end-date for the expected munni projection can be set via the bottom bar.
* New items/series can be created by tapping the plus icon in the top right, filling in the desired information, then tapping the tick in the top right to finalise. Whether an item or series is created depends on the context from which the plus icon was pressed.
* Long-tapping on an item or series brings up a context menu allowing for editing or deleting, in addition to items allowing for completion of the item.
* Tapping on the search icon at the top allows for searching for items and series by name/category
